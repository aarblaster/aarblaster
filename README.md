# 💡 Hi, I'm Anthony.
Theatre lighting designer, sometime coder, photographer, Mac nerd, coffee snob. Now in London but from Ngunnawal and Ngambri Country, Australia. 🐨

* 🤖 I make [MigraineBot](https://codebyanthony.com/migrainebot), an iOS app to help track your migraine attacks, because I couldn't find one I liked. [Download here.](https://apple.co/3eIpkY1)
* 🌱 I’m learning Swift, and coding more generally. It's an ongoing process.
* 🎓 I teach people to be Lighting Designers, Electricians and Lighting Programmers at a UK Drama School.
* 🎭 + 🧑‍💻 + 📷 is how I spend my days.
